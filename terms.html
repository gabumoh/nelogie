					of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Administrator, via any other method available to Administrator, including via <br>
					e-mail. The Notice to Administrator must be addressed to MUPO.COM ONLINE MARKETPLACE NIGERIA LIMITED (350, Borno Way, Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria), Attn: Chief <br>
					Executive Officer (the "Arbitration Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought <br>
					(the "Demand"). If you and Administrator do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Administrator may <br>
					commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL ADMINISTER <br>
					THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES <br>
					(THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing <br>
					fee to commence an arbitration against Administrator, then Administrator will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Administrator's <br>
					receipt of a Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand <br>
					is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.<br>
					<br>
					11.3. Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in Alexandria, Virginia <br>
					will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Administrator agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute <br>
					resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific <br>
					manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually <br>
					agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of <br>
					competent jurisdiction.<br>
					<br>
					11.4. No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND ADMINISTRATOR AGREE THAT YOU AND ADMINISTRATOR MAY BRING CLAIMS <br>
					AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE <br>
					PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT <br>
					OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, <br>
					THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.<br>
					<br>
					11.5. Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. <br>
					The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and <br>
					all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in <br>
					writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting <br>
					the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal <br>
					Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Section 11.<br>
					<br>
					11.6. Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11 do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, <br>
					trademarks, or patents. For the avoidance of doubt, however, you acknowledge that, in the event Administrator or a third party breaches this Terms and Conditions, the <br>
					damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Administrator, and your only remedy will be for monetary <br>
					damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Terms and Conditions.<br>
					<br>
					11.7. Claims. You and Administrator agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this <br>
					Terms and Conditions or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of <br>
					action is permanently barred.<br>
					<br>
					11.8. Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Administrator must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this <br>
					Section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Administrator may recover attorneys' fees and reimbursement of its costs, <br>
					provided that Administrator has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.<br>
					<br>
					11.9. Modifications. In the event that Administrator makes any future change to the "Mandatory Arbitration" paragraph set forth above (other than a change to <br>
					Administrator's Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Administrator's <br>
					Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Administrator and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in <br>
					effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Terms and Conditions.<br>
